Donations, large or small, are ALL appreciated: https://paypal.me/minusthegym‚Äã  Thank you! ‚ù§Ô∏è\n\nI've had several comments asking what to do if you're starting calisthenics overweight and find the basic exercises to be too difficult. In this video I outline a simple 3-step approach that anyone can follow to start calisthenics safely and effectively, even they're very overweight. \n\nThe 3 methods I recommend to approach weight loss are: \n1) Intermittent fasting\n2) Low-impact cardio\n3) Progressive exercises \n\nIntermittent fasting probably doesn't need an introduction.  It's all over the place these days, and I have a couple videos about it on my channel already.  Using intermittent fasting to get into a caloric deficit is going to be the single most effective tool in dropping weight fast.\n\nNext, you want to start doing some form of low-impact cardio, especially if you're coming from a sedentary lifestyle.  The method I recommend is daily walking.  It's low-impact, very good for your overall body and highly effective for fat loss.  But, if you're into cycling, swimming, or any other low-impact exercise, do whatever you enjoy.\n\nLastly, I recommend changing the angle of leverage in your exercises to make them progressive.  This essentially means changing the angle at which your body is to the ground so that you'll have less load coming down on your body from gravity.  Leverage is actually a concept that applies to weightlifting and moving the joints, but it can be applied to calisthenics often make progressive versions of each exercises.  I explain this in detail in this video and my beginner routine video as well.  \n\nI hope this helps!  Let me know in the comments what other questions you  might have. \n\n-Ryan\n\nStock footage credits:\nOverweight man trying pull ups: ¬© motortion | Dreamstime.com\nWeight lifting stock footage: Videvo \n\nMusic: \nLightness by Nomyn https://soundcloud.com/nomyn‚Äã\nCreative Commons ‚Äî Attribution 3.0 Unported  ‚Äî CC BY 3.0 \nhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/b‚Äã...\nMusic promoted by Audio Library https://youtu.be/yTIFnD_iAyM‚Äã",
